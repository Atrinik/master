<title>Choosing a Deity</title>
If you plan to utilize divine powers you must have the skill Divine Prayers and you must choose a cult of a higher being.

To become a follower, find a holy altar of your cult, step onto the altar and apply it. The divine spirit inside this altar will touch your soul, attuning your mortal being to your new deity.

Beware though, if you already have a deity and you touch an altar of a different deity, you will be punished most severely.

Return to the temple of your cult regularly and apply the altar. This will please your deity... And rest assured, the gods do know how to reward a worthy disciple!
<p>
<title>Prayers</title>
Next you must learn prayers. Priests, churches and various others will teach you prayers. There are also rumors about Prayer books lost in ancient tombs ages ago...

Some prayers will have different effects for every cult. Good starting prayers are, for example, "cause light wounds" and "minor healing".
<p>
<title>Grace</title>
Casting prayers will drain your grace, which can only be replenished by praying. If your maximum grace is too low you should try to increase your Divine Prayers skill or your Wisdom stat.
<p>
Never lose faith! Rumors abound of divine prayers of incredible power, and of old and wise priests who have nearly reached immortality...

# Curing diseases

name On the Cure of Disease
msg
You find a lengthy treatise on disease and its cure. Some diseases, apparently, are more difficult to cure than others, and require a higher level of skill.
Other diseases can be expected to run their course and go away without causing serious harm, unless of course, one is in a
situation in which temporary incapacity is fatal.
The cure disease spell is effective against disease, except as remarked above. Restoration also works well against disease.

Cure wounds spells won't cure disease, but they will reduce symptoms. Cure wounds spells therefore can be used to keep a person alive until the disease may be cured.
Also, they may keep him alive until the disease naturally goes away.

There are also claims of herbal, alchemical, animal, or other magical cures for disease, but these belong in another treatise.

name History of Crossfire
msg
Frank Tore Johansen started writing Crossfire in March 1992. Since then several people throughout the world have contributed with source, maps and graphics.

The earlier versions looked a lot like the game Gauntlet. Then it started adopting the features of Nethack and Moria.

Now it is moving in the direction of more complex games like Ultima. But during all those years, Crossfire has developed its very own unique style.

<book>The Abandoned Mine</book><title>Entrance</title>
The entrance has an inscription written on the gate:

<b>Pedo mellon a minno!</b>

Which translates to:

<b>Speak friend and enter!</b>

The riddle, as I figured out, is that you need to say <b>Mellon</b> for the gate to open.

<p>
<title>Moroch Temple</title>
Not much is known about this temple, which is rumored to be hidden somewhere in the mine. It is said to be an entrance with an altar devoted to Moroch, with several portals leading to the same dimension in which Moroch Temple is, and as the rumor says, Moroch himself.

<p>
<title>One-way exits</title>
The mine is supposed to have one-way exits to both Fort Ghzal and Giant Mountains. There may be other exits from the mine, and, quite possibly, other entrances apart from the main one.

<b>About the Brynknot Lake Portal...</b>

<title>Facts:</title>

The portal appeared shortly after Brynknot was built.

According to the Elders, many people entered the portal wondering where it would take them.

Those entering the portal were never seen again.

It was decided that the danger of the portal was too great and the Elders tried many things to close the portal, but failed. Thus, they built the lake around the portal. It now stands as a symbol to those that were lost to it.

The hole on the island leads to sewers under the city.

The small dragon that can be seen appeared shortly after they filled the area around the portal with water. It was feared at first, but soon people realized the dragon seemed to ignore them and posed no threat.

<title>Rumors:</title>

It is said that the portal leads to a Great City below the ground.

The portal is a pathway to the Gods.

Some drow prisoners have claimed that humans attacked them first, coming to their city uninvited. Thus it was the humans that started the war.

It is said that those that made it to the other side of the portal were unable to re-enter the portal on the other side to get back.

Those that enter the portal become immortal.

Much gold, silver, and jewels await those that enter the portal.

Demons and creatures with many eyes await those that enter the portal.

If you leave an offering to the small dragon that pleases him, he will give you a golden ring.

The small dragon was summoned by a sorcerer who lives on the other side of the portal.

We are going into the portal today. I am saying goodbye to my family, telling them I will see them when I get back. We don't know if it is safe, or where the portal leads, but we are going to find out in about an hour.

<title>7:00</title>
We leave now. Here goes nothing.

<title>7:05</title>
We seem to be in some sort of a city. From what we can see, it is under the ground. Incredible...

<title>7:10</title>
We can hear a lot of noise all around us, it seems that we were not as quiet as we should have been. There seems to be a group coming towards us. We are prepared to defend ourselves if it is necessary, but I hope it won't come to that.

<title>7:20</title>
Drow... They don't seem happy to see us. They are yelling something about "death to the humans" and "save the king at all cost". Upon hearing what the drow were saying, we tried to go back through the portal. It doesn't work. We are stuck here.

<title>7:25</title>
We have tried to talk to them, but they won't listen and are preparing to attack. There are hundreds of them, it is impossible we can overpower them. The leader of the group just laughed when we tried to leave, and told us that only those that possess the amulet of Llwyfen can pass through the portal. I have heard that the mayor of Brynknot is a follower of Llwyfen.

<title>7:30</title>
I hear their war cries. We have no means of esca... <img=wall_blood1.u.151 -5 -10>
