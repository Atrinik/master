Compiling the Atrinik client (GNU/Linux)
=================================================

Several libraries and programs are needed in order to compile and/or run
the Atrinik client:

    SDL: Required
    SDL_image: Required
    SDL_mixer: Optional, if not installed sound support will not be
               available.
    SDL_ttf: Required
    Timidity: Optional, necessary to play MIDI background music files
    cURL: Required
    zlib: Required
    libx11, libxmu: Optional, necessary for clipboard support

In addition gcc and cmake are required to build the client. All the
necessary packages may be installed on Debian-like systems using the
following command:

    apt-get install libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev timidity libsdl1.2debian libsdl1.2debian-all libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev build-essential libx11-dev libxmu-dev cmake

After installing the necessary packages, you need to create the Makefiles
for the project using 'cmake .'. Then you can use 'make' to compile the
client. When the compilation is done, you can execute the 'atrinik'
binary to start the client.

Compiling the Atrinik client (Windows)
=================================================

Go to make_win32 directory, and choose your IDE. See the README file in
the chosen IDE's directory for further instructions.

Make sure to read MIDI.txt in the make_win32 directory for instructions
how to install GUS-compatible patches, in order to correctly play MIDI
files in the client.

Building Atrinik installer (Windows)
=================================================

Compile the project in release mode by editing (or creating) the file build.user
and adding the following at the end:

set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE "Release")

You will need to place tar.exe and gunzip.exe binaries to the client's
directory. You can download them here (or compile them yourself):

http://www2.cs.uidaho.edu/~jeffery/win32/

Then download latest ca-bundle.crt and place it in the client's directory:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt

Then run the following in the client's directory to build an installer:

cpack -G NSIS

Installing music and sound files files
