# Here you can customize various settings of the server build.
#
# Note that if you are using the Bazaar branch repository, you might want
# to create a build.user file and override the defaults setting here in
# that file, as the build.user file will be ignored by Bazaar, thus your
# changes won't be committed to the repository.
