            <message>This name is, of course, translated from its original language, but it basically means the same thing. You should be able to find a copy in the library but it's very popular here so someone may be reading them right now.</message>

            <message>Don't mind her. She knows a bit too much but she's a hard worker. You wouldn't really expect most fairies to be that smart, though... it's kind of weird. I wonder if maybe I should ask the summoning instructor to look into the spell I used to summon her.</message>
