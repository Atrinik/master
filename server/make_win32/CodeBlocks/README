To build the Atrinik server with Code::Blocks, you will need to:

1. Install Code::Blocks with MinGW compiler

2. Download Flex binary from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/flex-bin-zip.php (main page: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/flex.htm). Extract bin/flex.exe to server/make_win32/tools/flex.exe

3. Download pthread, zlib and cURL lib and dll files, place the dll files in the server root directory, and the lib files in a structure like so:
   - server
     - make_win32
       - CodeBlocks
         - share
           - include
             - curl
               - curl.h
               - ...
             - pthread.h
             - zlib.h
             - ...
           - lib
             - libcurl.a
             - ...

   For your convenience, you can download all of the dll and lib files used to compile the official server from here:
     lib files: http://www.atrinik.org/download/win32/atrinik-server-share-codeblocks.zip (extract here)
     dll files: http://www.atrinik.org/download/win32/atrinik-server-dll-codeblocks.zip (extract in server root directory)

4. Double click on the Code::Blocks workspace file

5. Build workspace
