Name: object_id
Title: Object ID
DM: 1

When a help page mentions <b>object_id</b> in syntax parameters, it means you have to specify object name (often without spaces) or its ID (which can be found by using examine on the object, near the top saying 'count xxxxx': the xxxxx is the ID).

If you use the object's ID, you have to put a hash symbol in front of it, for example:

/patch #86301 no_pick 1

It's easier to use the object's name, but many objects have spaces in the names, and many commands (like /patch above) don't allow you to include spaces in the object's name:

/patch guard friendly 0
/remove skeleton mage

The IDs/names will first be checked against the online players (not in their inventories though), then below you (including inventories), and at last on the whole map the DM is standing on (including inventories).

Name: music player
Title: Music Player Widget
You can use the music player to play your favorite tunes from the game, or play them all one-by-one in random order (shuffle).

Note that if you use the music player, in-game areas won't change your music until you click <b>Stop</b>.

The <b>Currently playing</b> field will show you name of the current music file being played, either by the music player or in-game area.

<title>Controls</title>

Use mouse wheel or drag the slider to scroll the list of music files. To play a music file, either double-click it, or select it by left-clicking it once and click on <b>Play</b>. The selected music file will loop infinitely, or until the <b>Stop</b> button is pressed (which replaces the <b>Play</b> button if the music player is playing something).

Click the <b>Shuffle</b> button to play music files at random. When one songs ends in the shuffle mode, no looping is done, but instead next one is chosen at random.

In order to stop all background music for the current client session, you can double-click <b>Disable music</b> at the end of the music list.

If you stop the music player and you want the in-game area music to return, you will have to re-enter the area.
