                <message>Ah, good! You seem much more confident now - almost the same person I have seen in you when you first came to me and hired me to transport you to Strakewood.</message>
                <message>Very well then. Are you packed up and ready to go?</message>

            <info>You have reached Incuna, and have started the attempt to get back your lost memories. Sam Goodberry has suggested that you go speak to the local church priest, who may be able to help you.</info>

                    <message>There you are! I didn't wake you up when we arrived in Incuna, because it seemed like you needed a good rest. You certainly did - you've been sleeping for quite a while now.</message>
                    <message>At any rate, we did it - we managed to reach Incuna. We should resupply and head to Strakewood at last - but don't worry, I'll handle that and anything else we may need.</message>
                    <message>However... there's still the question of what to do about your memory loss. Say, has it improved?</message>

                    <message>Well, at any rate, I think you should visit the local church priest. Brelend Lee is his name, if I remember correctly. You should be able to find directions to him easily, perhaps by asking around the local townsfolk. A map would come in handy, hmm... I know, go visit Gulliver in the dock house. He's an old friend of mine, he might have a spare map for you.</message>
                    <message>Ah, one last thing! Here, take the rest of our mushroom supplies - I'll get us something better. No offense, but I feel I wouldn't be able to stomach any more of those things...</message>
