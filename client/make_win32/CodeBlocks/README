To build the Atrinik client with Code::Blocks, you will need to:

1. Install Code::Blocks with MinGW compiler

2. Download SDL, SDL_mixer, SDL_image, SDL_ttf, pthread, zlib and cURL lib and dll files, place the dll files in the client root directory, and the lib files in a structure like so:
   - client
     - make_win32
       - CodeBlocks
         - share
           - include
             - SDL
               - SDL.h
               - SDL_mixer.h
               - ...
             - curl
               - curl.h
               - ...
             - pthread.h
             - zlib.h
             - ...
           - lib
             - libSDL.dll.a
             - libcurl.a
             - ...

   For your convenience, you can download all of the dll and lib files used to compile the official client from here:
     lib files: http://www.atrinik.org/download/win32/atrinik-client-share-codeblocks.zip (extract here)
     dll files: http://www.atrinik.org/download/win32/atrinik-client-dll-codeblocks.zip (extract in client root directory)

3. Double click on the Code::Blocks workspace file

4. Build workspace
