Compiling the Atrinik server (Windows)
=================================================

 === Prerequisites ===

 - MinGW
    The compiler that you will use for compiling. Download it here:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download?source=files

    After installing, execute the mingw-install-prereq.bat script in "tools"
    directory (located in Atrinik root directory).
 - CMake
    Required to build makefiles. Download it here:

    http://www.cmake.org/files/v3.0/cmake-3.0.2-win32-x86.exe
 - Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables 2008
    This is required for OpenSSL to work properly. Download it here:
    http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29
 - OpenSSL
    Atrinik requires OpenSSL. Download it here:

    http://slproweb.com/download/Win32OpenSSL-1_0_1j.exe

    The installer will ask where to copy OpenSSL DLL files. Make sure this is
    set to the system directory.
 - cURL
    Atrinik requires cURL. Download it here:

    http://curl.haxx.se/gknw.net/7.39.0/dist-w32/curl-7.39.0-devel-mingw32.zip

    Extract the archive and copy "lib" and "include" directories into
    C:/MinGW (or where you installed MinGW).
 - GD Graphics Library (optional, recommended):
    If you want to generate client maps you will need to install this library.

    Download libpng sources from here:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/files/libpng16/1.6.14/libpng-1.6.14.tar.gz/download

    Extract to C:/MinGW/msys/1.0/home/<your username> and open bash through the
    Windows run dialog in start menu (C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin\bash.exe). In the
    extracted directory run the following (adjust the prefix if necessary):

    export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
    ./configure --prefix=/c/MinGW
    make && make install

    Download GD sources from here:
    https://bitbucket.org/libgd/gd-libgd/downloads/libgd-2.1.0.tar.gz

    Extract to C:/MinGW/msys/1.0/home/<your username> and open bash through the
    Windows run dialog in start menu (C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin\bash.exe). In the
    extracted directory run the following (adjust the prefix if necessary):

    export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
    ./configure --prefix=/c/MinGW --with-png=/c/MinGW
    make && make install
 - Check (optional)
    This is only needed if you want to do development and is used to run unit
    tests. Download it here:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/check/files/latest/download

    Extract to C:/MinGW/msys/1.0/home/<your username> and open bash through the
    Windows run dialog in start menu (C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin\bash.exe). In the
    extracted directory run the following (adjust the prefix if necessary):

    export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
    export CFLAGS="-DPTW32_STATIC_LIB"
    ./configure --prefix=/c/MinGW
    make && make check && make install

 === Compiling ===

 Make sure you have the following paths in your PATH environment variable, in
 this order (adjust accordingly if you installed MinGW or CMake somewhere else):

 C:\MinGW\bin;C:/MinGW/msys/1.0/bin;C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake\bin

 Install Netbeans for C/C++. Download it here:

 https://netbeans.org/downloads/start.html?platform=windows&lang=en&option=cpp

 Go to Tools -> Options -> C/C++ -> Build Tools and click the Add button. Enter
 C:\MinGW\bin (or where you installed MinGW) into the "base directory" box.

 Go to File -> New Project -> C/C++ Project with Existing Sources and select the
 server directory. Click "Finish" and the project should build automatically.
